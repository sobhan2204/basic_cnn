# CNN Image Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into 10 categories:


## 📌 Overview

This image classifier is trained on a dataset similar to CIFAR-10. The model takes an image as input and outputs the predicted class name. The CNN architecture is built using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose one based on your implementation).

## 🧠 Classes

The model can identify the following image categories:

- ✈️ Airplane  
- 🚗 Automobile  
- 🐦 Bird  
- 🐱 Cat  
- 🦌 Deer  
- 🐶 Dog  
- 🐸 Frog  
- 🐴 Horse  
- 🚢 Ship
